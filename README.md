# Work division and working together:

After getting this project by Masai in construct week. 
We all went through the actual website to understand the entire flow and noted down all the important features which were to be implemented. 
We all decided that Vikash will lead the team. Vikash has created a roadmap for the project (Structure of the project, 
division of work among members with specific timelines). We used to meet twice a day (Scrum and Standup). 
Our discipline, dedication, coordination, and cooperation helps us to complete this project on time.
